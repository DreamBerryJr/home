                    <div style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: large; font-weight: 700;">Introduction <br /></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>My dream is to provide a quality education to our children. The children are highly educated
                        but they do not have sense of responsibilities, moral values and know the power of education.
                        So even after education our childrens are behind in all sense. The education they get are not 
                        used anywhere in life. They sheer waste their precious time of their life in schools.</p> <br />
                        
                        <p>My aim is to provide a sense of value. In our traditional way of schooling; in our madrasas and gurukul
                        the children are taught moral educations, which forms the basis of our society. Physical education to 
                        build immunity against germs and stay strong in life. Love for nature, understand the gift of God; our beautiful
                        nature and take care of it. Teach the fundamentals skills that are necessary to earn living.</p>
                        
                        <p>Today we are highly so called modernized but we lost the happiness; we are staying more tense. 
                            Our body are not so Physically strong to take the stress. We are highly unorganized, we learning new things
                            but keep forgetting old things. We learn new skills which are not applied anywhere in our life. Even after
                            graduation or attaining master degree, we are not so confident in our own subjects. </p> <br />
                        
                        <p>We have to change this, and this is the start. We need your suggestions to improve further. We need your 
                            support to make it success. We need your guidance to take it to the right level. We request you to get attach
                            with us and bless us with your prayer.
                        </p>
