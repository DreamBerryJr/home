                    Archimedes once said, “Give me firm place to stand upon and I can move the Earth”. This very platform was provided me by Mr. Arif Shaikh. I take the opportunity to express my gratitude towards my Project coordinator for her constant encouragement and guidance. As the saying goes “No matter how big and small an endeavor is, nothing is done in vacuum! It is done because the supporting roles of many others”. The development of the project is result of the collective efforts along with the productive input of many of my teachers and colleagues. I am grateful to each one of them.
                    This was my dream project where I want to set an example in Bhiwandi for the Pre-School teaching. We are open for sharing and helping others to build the school on similar lines. We are here to share our expriance and knowledge.
                    This acknowledgement is a small effort to express our gratitude to all those who have shown us the part to bring out various colors of this project with their vast treasures of experience and knowledge.
